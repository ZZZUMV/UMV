Sequencing data for IMV group from Aperiomics


Please deposit here your plasma DNA and RNA sequencing data from Aperiomics.  Pease also deposit a copy of your Aperiomics report.     Please also deposit short description of your infection route, date of infection,  immediate symptoms and current symptoms.  Tis can be simplly a Word file

Please use the same ID for sequencing data and clinical data so 

When we have all data uploaded  the plan is to share access to this depository with acadmic researchers in infectious disease field so they can search for novel pathogen sequences. 

This is our plan B in case if Aperiomics is not able to analyze these results.
